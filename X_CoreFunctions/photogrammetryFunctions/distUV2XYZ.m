%% distUV2XYZ
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  This function computes the world XYZ coordinates that correspond to a
%  set of distorted UV image coordinates for a given camera EO and IO
%  specified by extrinsics and intrinsics respectively. In order for UV to be solved,
%  one dimension of xyz must be specified and provided for each point.


%  Input:
%  intrinsics = 1x11 Intrinsics Vector Formatted as in A_formatIntrinsics


%  IOEO = 1x7 Vector representing [ x y z azimuth tilt swing focallength] of the camera.
%  XYZ should be in the same units as xyz points to be converted and azimuth,
%  tilt and swing should be in radians. Focal length is in pixels

%  UVd = Px2 list of distorted image UV coordinates of N points. Columns
%  represent U and V coordinates.

%  knownDim= string of either 'x','y', or 'z' specifiying which dimension
%  is known and provide by the user

%  knownVal=Px1 vector of known world coordinates of UV points specified.
%  World dimension is that of knownDim and rows should correspond to same
%  points as UVd.

%  Output:
%  xyz = Px3 list of world coordinates of N points. Columns represent X,Y,
%  and Z coordinates and rows should correspond to UVd points.
